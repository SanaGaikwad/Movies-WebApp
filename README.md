## What is full stack mvc framework?
* The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into 3 main logical components. They include the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle input).
* MVC adheres to the "Separation of Concern" principle because each component is built to handle a specific development aspect of the application.
* MVC has since evolved into a framework for creating cross-platform compatible applications using a variety of programming languages
* Symfony 5 is a web framework that uses the MVC concept

## Major Advantages of MVC
* Structuring- It helps create a solid structure of our application.
* Fast- Development of each component can be carried out in parallel which helps in faster development time.
* OOP Support- It works well with object-oriented programming, since the different models, views, and controllers can be treated as objects and reused within an application.
* Simple- The loose coupling helps in reducing the complexity of the web application, and makes it is easy to maintain and deploy.
* Cross-platform compatibilty- it reduces duplication of tasks by eliminating the need to create multiple versions for use on different operating platforms.
* Cost- Developers using web-form based development have to create multiple copies of the same application, which is expensive because it requires additional resources. With MVC, developers can create one application that is compatible with multiple devices and platforms.
* Performance- Pages built using MVC are much lighter than other architectures, which means they load faster and therefore enhance the application's performance.
